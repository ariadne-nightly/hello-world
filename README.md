   ## my first repository - my introduction
   ### February 22, 2023
   
I'm **Ariadne**, and this is my very first GitHub repository. I like to code[^1], and mainly do so in Java - but I'm also trying to learn
- Ruby (which is actually really, really fun),
- JavaScript (which is messy but super-efficient), and
- Haskell (which has a really steep learning curve, but it's also one of the most rewarding and pure languages you could ever learn).

I'm not particularly proficient in any of them right now - I _do_, however have experience with Logo, HTML and CSS and batch-script. I also enjoy fiddling around with browsers, mainly Firefox, but on occasion old ones like WorldWideWeb, Netscape, and text-based ones like Lynx.

I hope I'll be contributing more here in the future!
