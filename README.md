   # hello-world
   ## my first repository - my introduction
   
I'm **_ariadne-nightly_**, and this is my very first GitHub repository. I like to code, and mainly do so in Java. I also like to fiddle around with browsers, mainly Firefox Nightly, but occasionaly old ones like WorldWideWeb, Netscape, and text-based ones like Lynx. 

I hope I'll be contributing more here in the future!
